# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction

In this project, SpaceX launch data was programmatically gathered using the official SpaceX REST API. We sent HTTP GET requests to retrieve structured information about launches, rockets, payloads, and launchpads. Each API response returned JSON data, which we parsed and combined into a single dataset. This method ensured accurate and up-to-date information, sourced directly from SpaceX's backend systems, making the dataset reliable for further analysis, visualization, and model building.

## Description

This repository contains the analysis and modeling to predict the landing success of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. It uses Jupyter notebooks for data manipulation, exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning model building.

## Installation

1.  **Clone this repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anjali-jadhav-01/SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction.git
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**
    It is recommended to create a virtual environment, then install the required packages specified in the notebooks (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If a `requirements.txt` file does not exist, install the packages found in the notebooks.)*

## Usage

1.  Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2.  Follow the analysis flow to understand the data and the model.
3.  You can modify and experiment with the parameters and the model as desired.
